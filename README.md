Titanic machine learning project

This project aims to predict Titanic passenger survival using machine learning. It involves exploring and preprocessing the dataset, handling missing values, converting categorical variables, and feature engineering. Various models like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests are trained and evaluated. The best-performing model is used to make predictions on the test set, demonstrating the application of machine learning in solving real-world problems.</br>
